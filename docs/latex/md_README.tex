 An open-\/source game, Vim\+Ventures, is a space-\/themed odyssey to mastering vim! Currently in development, this game invites you to a unique adventure across the cosmos.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{What\textquotesingle{}s Vim\+Ventures?}{What\textquotesingle{}s Vim\+Ventures?}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
Imagine piloting a spaceship through the vast universe, but there\textquotesingle{}s a twist\+: solar flares are tampering with your ship\textquotesingle{}s source code! Your mission is to wield your vim skills to overcome these cosmic challenges and keep your ship on path to it\textquotesingle{}s next destination.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Why Vim\+Ventures?}{Why Vim\+Ventures?}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
I began my journey learning Vim at the end of 2022. I have learned much from the vim community and want to give back!

My goal is to create a fun, and accessible way to learn vim that will be useful for users of any proficiency. Here are some of the planned features\+:

{\bfseries{Fun and Functionality Combined}}\+: This isn\textquotesingle{}t just any game; it\textquotesingle{}s a vim-\/learning experience set against the backdrop of an interstellar voyage. There will be upgrades to your ship at the various stations you stop by, and a story that will keep you engaged throughout your journey.

{\bfseries{Thrilling Time-\/\+Sensitive Missions}}\+: Tackle urgent code repairs to keep your spaceship on course, adding a thrilling aspect to your learning.

{\bfseries{Venture\+Tutor (Name is WIP)}}\+: As you progress through missions, the game tracks actions you might have missed, aiming to enhance your vim efficiency for subsequent voyages. Whether you complete your mission or not, you\textquotesingle{}ll receive a list of your most missed actions, complete with demonstrations of where an alternative action could have been more efficient. For example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{You\ pressed\ 'x'\ the\ most\ efficient\ command\ here\ would\ be\ 'diw'}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{Under Construction\+:}} Alongside this being a contribution to the vim community, this is also a learning project for me!\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
Before installing, Vim\+Ventures relies on the following dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SDL2
\item X11
\item Alacritty
\item Vim
\end{DoxyItemize}

To install, perform the following inside of the root directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ .}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then, the game will be compiled inside of the {\ttfamily bin/} directory. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/VimVentures}

\end{DoxyCode}

The game is in its early stages. Contribution guidelines will evolve as the project matures towards a phase where building a collaborative community becomes feasible.
